- *Status*: ACCEPTED

## Context

`b3` source code (previously known as `learning.gem`) is legacy which has to be maintained and kept as history reference in the future.

## Decision

Do not modify folder structure, keep the existing one.

## Consequences

In case of potential back-merge into `learning.gem` as library the operation will be possible.

Git history will be available.
