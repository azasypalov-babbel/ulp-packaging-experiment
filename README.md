# lesson-player.spa

Lesson Player SPA which includes the trainers source files for Babbel's learning content.

This project consists of 3 sub-projects that make up the lesson-player.spa.

- :1st_place_medal:	[b4](./b4/README.md) - Core front-end for the lesson-player. In active development.
- :warning:	[b3](./b3/README.md) - Legacy front-end, consisting of individual trainers that are consumed by b4. Not in active development.
- :microscope:	[web.test](./web.test/README.md) - Automated testing for lesson-player front-end.

More context can be found in the project docs:

- [Content Model](./doc/content-model.md) - Describes the important entities in this domain.
- [Core Concepts](./doc/core-concepts.md) - Describes important domain concepts and architecture. (Lesson, Trainer, Item, Sequence...)
- [Service Layer](./doc/services.md) - Describes how we utilise our service layer to handle cross-platform integration.
- [Architecture decision record](./doc/decisions) - Describes important technical decisions made by the team.

## Setup

Please follow the installation steps in the relevant sub project.

## Usage

We are using docker to run the tests locally, see [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md)

### Selenium test suite / Docker

You need to do this in order to run our docker lesson-player.spa

#### E2E test lesson-player.spa in Docker Environment

Be sure to provide your Github packages token `PACKAGES_TOKEN` in your root `.env` file.

```bash
# run cucumber against specs tagged with @smoke_test
# by using the chrome-docker driver configuration
DRIVER="chrome-docker" CUCUMBER_ARGUMENTS="-t @smoke_test" docker compose up --build --force-recreate
```

This will do deploy the stack as described by [./docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) after rebuilding the images and run [cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) at `./web.test`.

### Translations

- Install the [wti](https://github.com/webtranslateit/webtranslateit) CLI.
- Get access and log in to 'https://webtranslateit.com/'. Copy the **read-only** API key from the [ü¶Ñ CORE Web Frontend](https://webtranslateit.com/en/projects/15033--CORE-Web-Frontend).
- Initialize wti, and you will be asked to enter the key you just copied.

```bash
wti init
```

You can pull the translations using

```
./scripts/pull-translations.sh
```

Please never push translations! Do not use `wti push`.

Make yourself familiar with the [Product Localization Workflow](https://confluence.internal.babbel.com/display/BD/Product+Localization+workflow) and the guide to [WTI Key Translations](https://confluence.internal.babbel.com/display/BD/WTI+Key+Translation).

> :warning:	Main takeaway: Translation keys and translations should **only** be created/edited/deleted on the web interface of webtranslateit.

## Continuous Integration

Github actions handles the heavyload of running parallel unit tests, integration tests and deployments. We have two workflows:

### Build, Smoke Test & Deploy

[See workflow in action](https://github.com/lessonnine/lesson-player.spa/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build%2C+Smoke+Test+%26+Deploy%22)

This workflow validates linting rules, runs unit tests and builds the spa and storybook. It also runs a short list of smoke tests and sanity tests in Chrome. If those steps are all successful it will copy the application bundle so that it's ready for manual deployment using [deploy.babbel.com](https://deploy.babbel.com/lessonnine/lesson-player.spa).

### Integration Test

[See workflow in action](https://github.com/lessonnine/lesson-player.spa/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Integration+Test%22)

Our goal is to have a `green master branch` which means that the daily CRON integration test run on Github should not be broken. In order to make sure a code change doesn't break the integration tests, it is advisable to run them prior to any merge to master. This is _not_ done implicitly! There are two ways to run the integration tests:

- on the developer's computer [see DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md)
- on Github if one adds `run_tests` to the last commit message

### Documentation Diagrams

We are using [PlantUML](plantuml.com) to create and maintain diagrams in our documentation.

You'll find the source code for all diagrams in `doc/diagrams/src`. Diagrams are written in code (see plantUML for the syntax documentation) so they need to be generated and committed to the repo before they can be included in a document. To generate the diagrams do the following:

```
./scripts/generate-diagrams.sh
```

## Release Process

### QA builds
Before moving a ticket from "In Review" to "Ready for QA", the appropriate steps need to be taken to ensure QA is possible.

To test on web, branches can be deployed to staging via the [deployment app](https://deploy.babbel.com/lessonnine/lesson-player.spa) or via PR specific deployments.

To test on iOS devices, a Bitrise build (used only for QA) needs to be created, which can be done through the steps below:
1) Checkout latest `core-ios` repo
2) Create new branch e.g. `qa/lesson-player-branch-name`
3) On this branch run the following script `./scripts/update_web_lesson_player.sh -b [LESSON-PLAYER-BRANCH]`
4) Push your branch
5) Go to [Bitrise](https://app.bitrise.io/app/) and head to iOS builds page
6) Hit ‚ÄúStart/Schedule Build‚Äù
7) Select your branch and the workflow: web_lesson_player
8) Once the build is complete you will be notified in the slack channel #bot-ios-web-lp
9) Add the Bitrise build download page on the ticket and / or send it directly to the relevant stakeholders
### Releasing for webview on iOS

The iOS release process is owned by the `core.ios` project. The lesson-player.spa is a dependency to that release process.
Before the release of the native iOS app we must first designate the commit at which the lesson-player should be built for that release.
For details about specific dates, refer to the [Mobile Release Calendar](https://confluence.internal.babbel.com/display/PRM/Mobile+Release+Calendar).

### Submitting the Release Candidate

The following process should be carried out prior to the "Cutoff" date for a given release.

#### lesson-player.spa

- In lesson-player.spa create a branch from master to identify the release branch

```
git checkout master
git checkout -b release-ios-xx.xx.x
git push --set-upstream origin release-ios-xx.xx.x
```

- Update the `CHANGELOG.md` with the changes since the last iOS release (See example of [diff changes](https://github.com/lessonnine/lesson-player.spa/compare/ios-20.56.0...ios-20.57.0))
  - Use this script for help, but **make sure you check the result manually** as this is only a helper script `$ ./scripts/changelog.sh`. Some merges might be missing in the script's output, and some should be grouped if they are related by topic
  - Update the 'Fix Version' field of any tickets related to the changes if the changes affect iOS. There is documentation about it on [confluence](https://confluence.internal.babbel.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=248481719)
- Open a new PR from this branch (See example [lessonnine/lesson-player.spa#2915](https://github.com/lessonnine/lesson-player.spa/pull/2915)) and label it on github with 'waiting for app store release'

#### core.ios

- From the `core.ios` project [Updating the bundled lesson player](https://github.com/lessonnine/core.ios/blob/develop/docs/development_workflow/README.md#updating-the-bundled-lesson-player) using the branch above.
- Open a PR in the `core.ios` and **be sure to get it approved and merged before the release branch and candidate ("release/xx.xx.x") there are created**. (See example [lessonnine/core.ios#2838](https://github.com/lessonnine/core.ios/pull/2838))
- The exact timing is communicated in the slack channel `#releases-ios`

### Tagging the version

*Once the version has been published* (The release branch in the [core.ios](https://github.com/lessonnine/core.ios) project "release/xx.xx.x" has been merged),
we are ready to attach the `ios-xx.xx.x` tag to the commit of lesson-player.spa that was used to create the new core.ios version.

- In lesson-player.spa checkout the release branch

```
git checkout release-ios-xx.xx.x
```

- Push a tag to mark the release as finished

```
git tag ios-xx.xx.x -m "Finish release ios-xx.xx.x"
git push origin ios-xx.xx.x --no-verify
```

- Finally merge the PR in lesson-player.spa (probably there is the need to update the branch with master before)

## Typescript: A Process

Given the size, complexity, and importance of the lesson-player to the Babbel experience, as a team, we have commited to migrating to [Typescript (TS)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The static types that this yields, offers us:

- Increased code predictability, readability and documentation.
- Bring Babbel‚Äôs content model into code so that we can be more consistent with how the lesson-player.spa interacts with other parts of Babbel‚Äôs infrastructure.
- Using types as a means to document and validate the code we write so that it is easier for new team members to understand and for R2D2 to maintain.
- Catching data flow bugs in component compositions.

More context and information regarding this decicion is detailed [here](./doc/decisions/AD-07-static-types.md).

The migration is iterative and ongoing, so it is important that all engineers follow the same practices and align on their approach. Therefore, all engineers working on this codebase agree to:

- Migrate files that are touched to TS. This can either be done manually or via a script more details [here](./b4/README.md#ts-migration-script)
- When working on a task, the initial TS renaming and type fixes should be merged to master before starting the work required for the task itself. This is to avoid the renaming / types being stuck in branches for a long time.
- When working on React components, PropTypes should be removed and replaced with an [interface](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html) in the component file.
